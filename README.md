I built an online ticket booking system using Python (Flask), MySQL, and HTML/CSS to allow users to search, book, and manage tickets for events. The system included user registration, login, and booking management features, all backed by secure authentication and session handling. I implemented CRUD operations for users to add or cancel bookings and integrated SQL queries to manage event availability and ticket inventory. The application used form validation to prevent invalid inputs and incorporated basic security measures like input sanitization to protect against SQL injection. The frontend interface provided a clean and intuitive user experience, and the backend APIs ensured smooth interaction with the database for real-time updates.
